## Brief introduction
**Signature** is a behavioral trait of 
an individual and forms a special class of 
handwriting in which legible letters or 
words may not be exhibited. Signature verification is a method to prevent unauthorized access, which is widely adopted on bank and legal system.  Signature verification systems are divided in two categories: online (dynamic) and offline (static). In the online case, an acquisition device, such as a digitizing table, is used to acquire the user’s signature. The data is collected as a sequence over time, containing the position of the pen, and in some cases including additional information such as the pen inclination, pressure, etc. In offline signature verification, the signature is acquired after the writing process is completed. In this case, the signature is represented as a digital image.
